# 🏦 Banker's Desk

**Banker's Desk** is a modern, interactive banking interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It simulates a digital banking experience where users can log in, view their account activity, transfer money, request loans, and close their accounts — all through a clean, single-page interface.

## 🔐 Login Section

The app begins with a login form. Users must enter a valid **username** and **PIN**. If correct, the user's account dashboard is revealed.

## 🏦 Request Loan Section

Just below the transfer section, users can request a **loan from the bank**.

- If eligible (e.g., if a deposit meets certain criteria), the loan is approved and added to the account.
- No backend — logic is simulated in JavaScript.
